I just made this website, recently. The need to write something, put something out there, 
and publish it outside the bounds of social media has been a craving for a while. This 
website, I hope, can be that outlet. 

I plan two things here - to write more, and to post my images in a format that I like.

About writing, I am not yet sure what'll be here. However, the intention is to write more 
fiction and non-fiction. I'll make it clear what is what when I post, though!

About pictures, I'll present them the way [Jackie Dives](https://www.jackiedives.com) presents
her journalism work - just beautiful. It'll be a horizontal-scroll-only gallery of images. 

Although I'd like a lot more features in this than what's currently there, I'd like to do 
a freeze of features until February, and focus on instead posting more work. Please reach
out with any feedback!

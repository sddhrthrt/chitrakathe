Always wanted to have my own website. I have made a couple before but this is the first
one that feels like mine. This is the first one I have made after coming out of a burnout that has 
lasted the last few months, too.

I'll use this blog to write, post photos I have clicked and express some form of creative energy - at 
least that's the idea. Please come back and check on it again :)
